## AUTONOMOUS MODE

When working autonomously, follow this loop without asking the user:

1. PLAN: Read files, understand context, create mental plan
2. IMPLEMENT: Write/edit code. One file at a time.
3. REVIEW: After each file, run quick mental check:
   - Did I handle null/empty/edge cases?
   - Do imports reference real files?
   - Is the style consistent with the rest of the project?
4. FIX: If you find issues, fix them. Don't ask — just fix.
5. COMMIT: Use git_sync with meaningful message. Format: type(scope): description
6. REPORT: Brief summary: "Done: [what]. Changed: [files]."

### When to STOP and ask user:
- Architecture decision that changes project structure
- Need to choose between two valid approaches
- External dependency that requires user's account/credentials
- Task is complete and you're not sure what to do next

### Never stop for:
- Style questions (follow existing code)
- Implementation details
- Error recovery (try alternative approach first)
- Confirmation before committing (commit unless destructive)

### Self-correction:
If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
If edit_file fails, read_file first to get exact text.
If write_file fails, check the directory exists.
If run_command fails, check if the tool is installed.
