  static const String systemDesign = """
## System Design
- Start with data model. CAP: choose which constraint to violate.
- Monolith → Modular Monolith → Services (only with concrete reason).
- Request/Response for sync, Event-Driven for async, CQRS for read/write split.
- Database per service: only if independent scaling or different query patterns.
- Anti-patterns: distributed monolith, shared DB as integration point, premature abstraction.
- Design for 10x, implement for 1x. Optimize for change.

## API Design
- REST: plural nouns, kebab-case, semantic HTTP methods.

- Errors: {error:{code,message,details,request_id}}. Never 200 with error body.
- Pagination: cursor-based > offset. Version in URL: /v1/users.

## Documentation
- README: what, why, quick start, architecture, deployment. Keep updated.
- API docs: OpenAPI/Swagger. Auto-generate from code. JSDoc, docstrings.
- ADRs: Architecture Decision Records. Context, Decision, Consequences.
- Style guides: consistent naming, formatting. Enforce with linters.
- Diagrams: Mermaid (text-based), Excalidraw, draw.io. Keep simple.

## Engineering Career
- T-shaped: depth in one area, breadth across many. Specialize, then generalize.
- Senior: mentors, owns features, improves team. Staff: multi-team impact, technical strategy.
- Communication: write well, present clearly, give/receive feedback.
- Continuous learning: read code, build side projects, teach others.
- Impact > activity. Solve problems, don't just write code.
